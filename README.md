# sustainable-qol-pca-svr-r
This repository contains R implementations of PCA and SVR used to identify dominant variance structures among indicators, while SVR is used for non-linear time-series forecasting in settings with limited observations. The code is intended for research and reproducibility purposes and does not imply causal inference or policy optimization
